<b>Copyright Infringement Notification</b>
<br><br>
To file a copyright infringement notification with us, you will need to send a written communication that includes the substantially following (please consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to confirm these requirements):<br>
1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. <br>
<br>
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. <br>
<br>
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. <br>
<br>
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted. <br>
<br>
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. <br>
<br>
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<br>
<br>
To expedite our ability to process your request, such written notice should be sent to our appointed email address: site.wapka.com@gmail.com.<br>
<br>
Please note that under Section 512(f) any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages. Don't make false claims!<br>
<br>
Please also note that the information provided in this legal notice may be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content.<br>
<h5>Retractions</h5>
After submitting a copyright infringement notification, copyright owners may realize that they misidentified content or they may otherwise change their mind. Wapka is therefore always glad to honor retractions of copyright claims from the party who originally submitted them.<br>
If you're a content owner, please make sure you send us the following information if you wish to retract a claim:<br>
<br>
A statement of retraction (such as "I hereby retract my claim of copyright infringement")<br>
The complete and specific URL of the resource in question<br>
<br>
An electronic signature (typing your full legal name will do)<br>
<br>
If you're a user affected by a copyright claim, you may reach out to the copyright owner directly in search of a retraction. Here's how you may do so:<br>
<br>
If the claimant has a Wapka account, the easiest way to contact him or her is through Wapka's private messaging feature.<br>
<br>
Please have the claimant contact us directly at site.wapka.com@gmail.com with all the items listed above.<br>
<br>
Please note that we will not process retractions that are not sent from the same alias that submitted the original claim.<br>
<h5>Counter-Notification</h5>
To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication that sets forth the items specified below.<br>
<br>
Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.<br>
<br>
Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers who are repeat infringers. So, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact a lawyer.<br>
<br>
A counter-notification must include the following specific elements:<br>
<br>
Identification of the specific URLs of material that Wapka has removed or to which Wapka has disabled access.<br>
<br>
Your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your Wapka account.<br>
<br>
The statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."<br>
<br>
Signature. A scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature will be accepted.<br>
<br>
We can only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a material has been disabled. For verification, we require that counter-notifications be submitted from the email address associated with the account.<br>
<br>
After we receive your counter notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter notification, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant.<br>
<br>
After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Wapka. In that time, the filer of the notice has the option of seeking resolution in the courts and obtaining an injunction that will keep the work offline. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.<br>
